# Changelog

#### n2n 2.4 (August 2018)

This is the first release after 2012 and thus it is focusing mainly
on making it work on current operating system versions, so that the
next release will be based on modern code

## New features
* Added deb/rpm packages
* Added systemd configuration files
* Added ability to read configuration files instead of using only the CLI (needed for packaging)
* Added n2n Android app
* Implemented simple API to embed n2n in applications (in addition to use it stand-alone)

## Improvements
* Major code cleanup
* Fixed compilation issues on MacOS
* Fixed Linux segmentation fault
