RPM Package
-----------

These steps should work with RPM based Linux distributions since rpmbuild was
split from the rpm utility (c RedHat 9).


To build an RPM the easy way follow these steps.

1. Build SRPM

$ cd n2n
$ scripts/mk_SRPM.sh

Look for where the src.rpm file was put ( "Wrote:" ).

2. Build binary RPM from SRPM

$ rpm -i path/to/n2n-<ver>.src.rpm
$ rpmbuild -bb n2n.spec


All this can be done as non-root user if you have a ~/.rpmmacros file with this
line in it:

%_topdir /home/username/rpmtopdir


To build an RPM the hard way follow these steps.

$ cp -a n2ndir n2n-2.0
$ tar czf n2n-2.0.tar.gz n2n-2.0
$ mv n2n-2.0.tar.gz /usr/src/redhat/SOURCES
$ cp n2ndir/n2n.spec /usr/src/redhat/SPECS
$ rpmbuild -bb n2n.spec
