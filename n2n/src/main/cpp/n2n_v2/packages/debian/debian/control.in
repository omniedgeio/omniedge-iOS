Description: a layer-two peer-to-peer virtual private network (VPN)
 n2n is a layer-two peer-to-peer virtual private network (VPN) which allows
 users to exploit features typical of P2P applications at network instead of
 application level. This means that users can gain native IP visibility (e.g.
 two PCs belonging to the same n2n network can ping each other) and be
 reachable with the same network IP address regardless of the network where
 they currently belong. In a nutshell, as OpenVPN moved SSL from application
 (e.g. used to implement the https protocol) to network protocol, n2n moves
 P2P from application to network level.
 .
 Edge is the edge node daemon for n2n which creates a TAP interface to expose
 the n2n virtual LAN.
